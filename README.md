# Pokémon Prism

This version of Pokémon Prism is based on the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

# About the ROM

Pokémon Prism is a generation 2 ROM hack developed by Koolboyman in partnership with TwitchPlaysPokemon.  In addition to taking place in a brand new region called Naljo, Prism adds a whole host of new features and fun activities which make it a truly unique Pokémon experience.

Pokémon Prism was featured on the [TwitchPlaysPokemon][tpp] stream in October 2016.

# About the developers

Koolboyman also developed Pokémon Brown, a ROM hack of Pokémon Red notable for establishing a new standard for ROM hacks.  Like Prism, Brown was featured on the [TwitchPlaysPokemon][tpp] stream in June 2016.

PikalaxALT is a proud member of the TwitchPlaysPokemon development team.  Before working on Prism, he contributed a large portion of the novel code and scripts that went into TwitchPlaysPokemon Anniversary Crystal, an ambitious catch-em-all hard-mode hack based on the Pokémon Crystal disassembly.  Anniversary Crystal's most prominent feature is its integration with an external AI developed by Beesafree, which adds an additional layer of difficulty.  Anniversary Crystal was featured on the [TwitchPlaysPokemon][tpp] stream in February/March 2016.
